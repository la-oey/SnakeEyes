        Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
    <p> Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study to find out more about decision

        <b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657-5100 to ask about your rights
        as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
        <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may
        learn more about basic questions pertaining to memory, perception, cognition, and learning. This knowledge may
        have benefits to society in fields ranging from education to design of airplane cockpits, but these benefits
        will be indirect.<br><br>
        <b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have

        Instructions for the game. Please read carefully.
    </p>
    <div>
    	<p>You win if you get <i>way more points than your opponent</i>.<br><br>

    	You will take turns playing each role: One person will privately roll a fair <b id="instructDiceSides"></b>-sided die, and report the number rolled. The other player will then respond if they think the die-roller was LYING, or telling the truth.<br><br>

        Here's how the points work:
        <p class="indent">The die-roller gets points for the number they reported that they rolled.</p>
        <p class="indent">The responder gets points for 10 minus the reported roll.</p>
        <p>Only the die-roller can see what they rolled. So, the die-roller doesn't neccessarily need to tell the truth ;). But be careful!<br><br> 

        <b>What happens if the responder DETECTS a lie?</b> If the die-roller was in fact lying, the responder gets +5 points, and the die-roller gets -5 points.</p>
        <p class="indent">E.g. Die-roller was lying: die-roller: -5 pts; responder: +5 pts</p>

        <p><b>What happens if the responder <i>thinks</i> it's a lie, but the die-roller was ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH?</b> Then the die-roller gains the points for what they rolled (as usual), and the responder gains the points for 10 minus the reported roll, except with a -5 penalty.</p>
    	<p class="indent">E.g. Die-roller was telling the truth: die-roller: +8 pts; responder: 2 - 5 = -3 pts</p>
    	
    	<p>This is what a round looks like:</p>
